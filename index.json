A lesser-known fact is that you can generate QR codes directly inside Google Sheets, without installing any add-ons or external software.\nIn this post, we’ll look at two approaches:\nA simple formula-based method A more powerful Google Apps Script approach for automation Why Use Google Sheets for QR Code Generation? # Google Sheets is a great choice when:\nYour data already exists in a spreadsheet You want to generate QR codes in bulk You prefer simple, maintainable solutions You want to automate repetitive work Method 1: Generate QR Codes Using a Formula # This is the quickest and easiest way.\nStep 1: Add Your Data # In column A, enter the text or URL you want to convert into a QR code.\nExample:\nA https://example.com Hello World Order-12345 Step 2: Use the QR Code Formula # In column B, enter the following formula:\n=IMAGE(\u0026quot;https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?size=200x200\u0026amp;data=\u0026quot; \u0026amp; ENCODEURL(A1))\nDrag the formula down to generate QR codes for all rows.\nHow This Works # The QR service generates an image from the provided text ENCODEURL() handles special characters safely IMAGE() renders the QR directly inside the cell No scripts. No add-ons.\nLimitations of the Formula Method # Depends on an external image service Cannot save QR codes as files automatically Limited control over automation and workflows This method is ideal for quick use cases and small datasets.\nMethod 2: Generate QR Codes Using Google Apps Script # For advanced workflows, Google Apps Script is a better option.\nWhat Apps Script Enables # Using Apps Script, you can:\nGenerate QR codes programmatically Save QR images to Google Drive Automatically name and organize files Trigger QR generation on button click or form submission Insert QR codes into Docs, PDFs, or emails Conceptual Workflow # Read values from a Google Sheet Generate a QR image URL Fetch the image as a blob Save it to Google Drive Optionally insert it back into the sheet Once generated, the QR codes are independent of formulas.\nExample Use Cases # Event badges or passes Inventory and asset labels Invoice or payment QR codes Google Form auto-responses Internal automation tools Formula vs Apps Script: Which Should You Use? # Requirement Formula Apps Script Quick setup ✅ ❌ Bulk automation ⚠️ ✅ Save QR as files ❌ ✅ Triggers \u0026amp; workflows ❌ ✅ Professional automation ❌ ✅ Final Thoughts # If you need something fast and simple, the formula-based approach works perfectly.\nIf you want automation, scalability, and file management, Google Apps Script is the right choice.\nIn upcoming posts, we’ll explore:\nWriting the actual Apps Script code Exporting QR codes as PDFs Automating QR generation from form submissions ","date":"28 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/qr-generator/","section":"Posts","summary":"What I plan to document here, and why this site exists in the first place.","title":"Google sheets QR generator","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"28 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/google-apps-script/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Google-Apps-Script","type":"categories"},{"content":" ","date":"28 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Hi, I'm Aayusha","summary":"","title":"Hi, I'm Aayusha","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"28 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"This site is a personal knowledge space.\nI work at the intersection of product, engineering, and automation.
