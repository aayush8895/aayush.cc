I decided to stop complaining and start visualizing.\nThe goal for this dashboard was simple:\nDaily Volume: How many new emails actually hit my inbox every day? Subscription Audit: Am I oversubscribed to junk? (Spoiler: Yes). Read Velocity: How many emails am I actually opening versus letting sit? The \u0026ldquo;Meta\u0026rdquo; Reason # If I’m being honest, the real reason for this project wasn\u0026rsquo;t just about email management—it was an excuse to finally dive into Streamlit and build a live dashboard using real-world data that updates itself. Gmail is the perfect \u0026ldquo;living\u0026rdquo; database for this.\nPart 1: The Data Pipeline (GAS \u0026amp; Gmail) # Date: February 11, 2026\nI started by using a Google Sheet as my backend, powered by Google Apps Script (GAS). However, fetching the data wasn\u0026rsquo;t as straightforward as I expected.\nThe Technical Hurdles # The 500 Limit: Gmail\u0026rsquo;s API limits you to 500 emails per fetch. Since I had a massive backlog, I had to be strategic about how I pulled them. The Timezone Nightmare: Initially, my script\u0026rsquo;s count didn\u0026rsquo;t match the actual Gmail count. I discovered that GAS was pulling the PST server time from the metadata, which didn\u0026rsquo;t align with my local time. Regex to the Rescue: The \u0026ldquo;actual\u0026rdquo; time we see in our inbox is buried in the email body. I tried using LLMs to write a regex to extract this, but it took a few tries (and a fresh chat context) to get a script that accurately parsed the time string. The Logging Logic # To keep the sheet clean and avoid duplicates on re-runs, the script now:\nLogs a Unique Thread ID. Captures the Subject Line and a direct Email Link. Checks for existing IDs to skip already-logged mail. The Feedback Loop: I extended the code to check if an email previously logged as \u0026ldquo;unread\u0026rdquo; has now been opened. If it has, the script checks a box and logs the current date as the \u0026ldquo;Read Date.\u0026rdquo; Part 2: The Infrastructure (The \u0026ldquo;Free\u0026rdquo; Stack) # Date: February 12, 2026\nI’m a big fan of high-performance setups with a $0 price tag. For this project, I leaned into the \u0026ldquo;Forever Free\u0026rdquo; ecosystem.\nComponent Service Used Database Google Sheets (via Apps Script) Hosting Oracle Cloud (Free Tier Perpetual Instance) IDE/Dev Env GitHub Codespaces Frontend Streamlit By linking GitHub Codespaces to my repository, I can now develop and tweak the dashboard from any browser—whether I\u0026rsquo;m on my laptop or just checking in remotely.\nWhat’s Next? # Now that the data pipeline is solid, I’m focused on the Streamlit UI. I want to build out specific \u0026ldquo;clutter\u0026rdquo; metrics to identify which senders are the worst offenders in my inbox. Stay tuned for the visual breakdown!.\n","date":"12 February 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/unread-email-dashboard-uding-gsheet-and-streamlit/","section":"Posts","summary":"i have got lot of emails pending on gmail and i want to know how many emails are coming every day and how many i am reading","title":"Unread mail dashboard using gscript and streamlit","type":"posts"},{"content":" Generate QR Codes in Google Sheets Using External URLs # I’ll show how to generate QR codes directly inside Google Sheets using external URLs.
