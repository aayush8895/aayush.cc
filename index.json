Gmail allows only 500 emails to be read at once, and i had near about unread emails. after fetching emails i would write counts of how many emails came in per day but when i tested the count written by acript and actual count was a mismatch. when i investigated the initial or last few emails were missing (i had log the subject that it counted for that particular day).upon further investigation i found out that it was taking server date time that is available to see when i open the view original message. Also that time was in PST format, this time was little different from the actual time shown because it was not off by any factor of 30 minutes. The actual time that we see on the email is actually inside the email body and string paring using reex need to written for it. after trying for 20 times gemini was not able to write code for it and i had to switch new chat and give very short instructions to achieve the time extraction. once this was done i was easily able to get what i wanted and it matched the count.\nso finally i logged all the emails, i also made sure on reruns it checks and skips already logged unread emails. inlogged unique thread id.time received, subject, email link and a checkbox.\nafter that i asked Gemini to extend the code to read the email unique ids from sheet and if any email is now read mark the check box to mark it as read and in another column log today\u0026rsquo;s date.\nFree of cost server setup # 12th Feb 2026\nI had found about about Oracle free perpetual server offering, so i wanted had already signed up for it earlier. now i set up a streamlit environment and github codespace linked to a github repo for this project.
